Married men just whispering to hisself, “goddamn, why did i bring her ass out tonight? There’s some motherf*cking stars in here tonight.”
You know n*gga’s looking out the corner of their eye every five minutes, looking like this every five minutes.
This is that one right here.
“…looking at the b*tch for?”
“N*gga, ain’t nobody looking at no b*tch.”
A man use any excuse to look at a girl.
“She look like your friend denise.”
“She don’t look like my motherf*cking friend.
Look at the b*tch again.”
“You got a purse like that.”
“Look at the b*tch again. I ain’t got no motherf*cking purse like that.”
Married men act totally different when they by theirself, don’t they?
You see them with their wife. “What’s up, Tony?”
“Hey, man, how’s everything going, brother? Oh, just taking it easy, hanging out with the old lady. All right, god bless you. Take it easy now. All right.”
Be like, “that n*gga ain’t like that!”
You see him by himself. “What’s up, Tony?”
“Hey, where’s the b*tches at, n*gga?!
Where’s the b*tch ass?”
“There your girl.” “Where? Where she at? Where she at? She just pulled up? She’s outside?”
Every man in here is scared of their f*cking girl.
These motherf*cking women are detectives.
Just when you think you’ve slipped, and they got your ass.
That’s right.
They’ll tell you they’re going to bed and get up and come looking for you.
“I’m going to bed.” “Okay, i love you. Bye. All right.”
N*gga think, “I’m going up, looking for this n*gga’s ass. I know where he at. He over at chuckie and them’s over on Feday street. I’m going to f*ck this n*gga up.”
Your friends be looking out for you.
“I think your girl’s out prowling. I just seen her car.”
And don’t fall asleep, fellas, before your girl ’cause they will ransack your shit.
You ever fall asleep and wake up and realize you ain’t got that phone in your pocket?
Be like, “oh, shit. My phone. Baby! What room you in?! This b*tch got my phone. Baby, what room you in? You seen your mama? Where your mama at? Where your mama? Baby!”
They get that motherf*cking phone, it is a wrap.
That’s a real nightmare right there, Detroit.
You in a cold sleep, and that’s all you hear — “who the f*ck is this?!”
You can’t believe it’s happening.
You be like, “is this a dream?”
You be looking with your eyes squinting and shit.
“Who is this, n*gga? Ain’t no sun in here.”
N*gga looking like the sun’s in his eyes.
“Ain’t no sun in here. Who is this?!” “I don’t know.”
“Call the b*tch.”
You walk around the house butt naked with some underwear on, calling b*tches.
“Yeah, this is mike. Uh, don’t never call me again, b*tch, yeah. F*ck you, you know what i mean?”
He could be looking at his girl, talking, “yeah, b*tch, don’t ever call me back again, you hear me?”
“Call the other b*tch. I’m not playing with you.”
“Yeah, this is mike. Uh, don’t never call me back again. You f*cking my family up, b*tch. Bye.”
“Don’t be saying ‘bye’ at the end, n*gga! You’re trying to leave some hope, ain’t you? I’m changing the number in the morning.”
You know, f*cking women put the pressure on the n*gga.
They want to feel your balls when you come in the house.
“Let me feel your nuts. Your nuts feel empty, man. How much did they weigh ‘fore I left, man?
“I didn’t say nothing when you had that bottle of vinegar next to the tub.”

She all in the kitchen, butt naked on her tippy toes, looking for batteries.
“Oh, my god. The feeling’s going away. I need some batteries.”
All in the kitchen drawers, “oh, my god, where’s the motherf*cking batteries?”
They finally take the batteries out the remote control.
“Get the channel you gonna watch. Put the motherf*cking remote control down. I’m taking the batteries out of here.”
[High-pitched buzzing]
They get mad when we got a porno tape in the motherf*cking house.
“Keep these b*tches out of my house!”
Motherf*cking frisbee -threw the motherf*cker.
“I don’t know them b*tches. They live in San Diego.”
Women love to catch a n*gga jacking off.
That’s why you got to have the remote control right here on your lap -so you can hit “stop” and put your d*ck under your shirt.
“Who is that?”

That’s how women walk in the door on your ass — just like this.

Oh, he somewhere right now with his shirt off, eating chicken wings, counting his money.
“Oh, I raked up pretty good.”
He just look at you with that little smirk like that.
You know how bush look at you, like, “you know I f*cked you. But what you gonna do about it? Nothing!”
They tried to f*ck Obama’s oath up.
You see when he had his hand up?
He had to stop and look at the man like, “I’ll slap the shit out you up here if you mess my shit up. Try to read my oath with a now and later in your mouth.”
You know Obama’s real.

“Talk about suck my d*ck, n*gga.”
They caught Jesse. Caught you, didn’t they, Jesse?
He sitting up there at the inauguration, crying, like he just so happy, looking like a drunk-ass Pekinese, just… “man, that sure was supposed to be me. Keep hope alive.”
He’s just a rotten motherf*cker, man.

“Watch out, king! Goddamn it! Get out the way!”

“And you’re dead, mom b*tch! You’re f*cking out of here, man!”

“Timmy, what’s the problem?”

Look at white people. “I don’t act like that. My son doesn’t do that.”
You come home from school, little Timmy in the garage making a bomb.
“What are you doing, Timmy?” “Nothing, mom! Get out of here now! That’s why you’re f*cking out of here!”
You ain’t never heard of a little black kid killing they mama, have you? ‘Cause there will be a shootout in that mother. You know, black mothers got instincts like they in Vietnam.
“What you doing in that room so motherf*cking long? You need to say something when you in there.”
“This is my room.”
You know them black mothers love jumping on they daughters. Them mamas and daughters always got that little rival thing after a while. You know when the daughters start getting spunky with her mama, tell her to do something.
“I’m-a do it. Shit.”
“What did you say? B*tch, I’ll knock your head in between that washer and dryer. Don’t talk that motherf*cking shit to me.”
You know, black mothers love to do that first jump on.
“Let’s get an understanding around here, Heifer.”
And then they call and tell everybody.
“I had to knock Shaniqua’s motherf*cking — I tried to kick that b*tch all behind the damn washer and dryer. I guess ’cause she got titties she think she running something around here. I had to let her know – buy your own tampons! Until you can buy your own tampons, don’t say a motherf*cking thing to me. B*tch will want to borrow a tampon, talk crazy back to a b*tch.”
Then the next two days – “I love you, baby. Want to go have lunch?”
“Yeah, if you didn’t beat me all upside the f*cking head and told everybody at the church.”
Black mamas will hit your ass anywhere — church, parking lot, court -any motherf*cking where. If you ever get hit, you be looking to see who seen it. Be a white man just looking at you like this.
“You better be careful, little buddy.”
“You better shut the f*ck up.”

My mother tried to raise us Jehovah’s Witness. I was like, “oh, hell, no. Not that. No f*cking Christmas gifts? F*ck this shit!”

“Get off my porch, b*tch.”
“Yep, the devil’s in there. Let’s get out of here, kids.”
Hey, it’s f*cking crazy out here. I want to turn my life over to God, but it is hard as hell. Every time something happen to us, that’s what we do.

I seen old ladies snap out of the holy ghost.
She’s like, “la-oh, hell, no! Now, that’s just taking advantage of a motherf*cker right there. That’s the third time he done sent the plate around here. Now, that’s it, now.”
They got families that know how to time that motherf*cking plate. You see a whole family get up. They know how to do it. You see the father get up first. Motherf*cker just start walking out. Kids be right behind him. Pastor, “look at this shit right there! Look at that! That’s what you call stealing, now.”
Some of them pastors need to quit it, for real. Like, them n*ggas that be on tv 4:30 in the morning. Be like, “n*gga, what the hell?”
“You got to understand. You see the lord — [screeches] let us turn the page 33, Corinthians 33:45. And it’ll tell you – you’ll see the — [screeches]” be like, “n*gga, it is the reason why you on the tv at 4:00 in the morning. You ain’t shit.”

You got to read the Bible after you watch that shit. I’m straightening my life up after this episode. That was f*cked up. I ain’t bullshitting. It can happen. They need to call “First 48” “First 48 Snitches,” ’cause them are some ratatouille-ass n*ggas on that show. I haven’t seen an episode yet where they didn’t tell.

Police, “wait a minute, n*gga. Who is Tony Clark?”
“I tell you who it is. Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go downtown. I’m ready to get a soda. I’m ready to drink a soda, baby, let’s do it. And you better get two 90-minute tapes ’cause I got a whole lot of shit I want to talk to you about.”

“In the first 48…” when they get the n*gga in the room, she go right in there at him.
“Now, little cookie, you know that I know that everybody in the hood know who killed little poo-poo Thursday night.”
This is how you know the n*gga gonna tell, when they go like this – [sighs] “booyah! I think we got him!”
When they come back from a commercial, n*gga been saying something. You can tell ’cause he got a cigarette. N*gga relaxed.
“Yeah, I seen a little something-something-something.”
By the time the show’s going off, this n*gga at red lobster.
“I seen three murders. Give me that butter right there. Put that…”
“N*gga, you done told for an ultimate feast?”
What I can’t understand about a n*gga telling, n*gga still go to jail.

“They took everything. I didn’t even have $15 to put on any n*gga’s books.”

“Take me to the mall, baby. You know I just came home, man. Gonna get me right, baby! Take me to Northland, baby, get me a sweater! Yeah, man, take me there, man.”
They tell everybody, too.
“Yeah, Tony got me two sweaters. I just got two sweaters. Tony gave me two sweaters. I got a pair of pants the other night.”
See the n*gga a year later. “Man, you know I just came home, don’t you?”
“N*gga, you’ve been home for a while now. Quit lying, motherf*cker.”
And if you’ve been selling dope for 20 years and you ain’t got shit, it’s probably time to get a job.
I’m being straight up.
You can make more money on a job than them those kibbles and bits. You been throwing rocks at the penitentiary for $140 a week, anyway. For $140 a week. You might as well go get a job. You in it for the lifestyle, not the paper. You’re tricking b*tches with a gold chain.

Shoulders be up.
“Come here. Get grandma some toilet paper.”
Puh! Puh! Puh!
Sometimes she lift her whole ass up.
Puh! Puh! Puh!
It look like Chris Brown is the new Ike turner.

We don’t know what that Frankenstein-head b*tch did to him. There’s two sides to the motherf*cking story.
Shit, I’m down with the women, you know what I mean?
But the new law is…
♪ Whoever get the phone first, the other one’s goin’ to jail ♪
Shit, n*ggas be calling now.
“Yeah, uh, my wife just hit me in the eye. Get down here now.”
They don’t f*ck around with that shit.
They will give a n*gga a basketball-jersey number for that shit.
One time, my girl called the police and hung up.
Them motherf*ckers still came out.
“Unfortunately, um, somebody got to go down.”
I was like, “for what?”
“Um, taxpayer’s dollars. You made us come out here.”
She looking at me. I’m looking at her.
I went down there and got her, man.
She was madder than a motherf*cker.
What? I had to work that night.
She in the car like… [screams]
I’m like, “I know. I know how it is.”
[Sighs]
I’m just bullshitting. I’m just playing.
They all jokes, motherf*ckers – jokes.
Y’all get sensitive and shit.
Now I’m in the movies.
Motherf*ckers just want me to crack a joke all the goddamn time.
I’ll just be at places, man.
“Say something funny.”
Be like, “n*gga, you say something funny.”
People just walk up and ask stupid-ass questions.
“You talk to ice cube every day?”
“No, motherf*cker!”
Stupid shit.
And people love to call me day-day.
How long am i gonna be day-day?
[Cheers and applause]

Yeah, it’s crazy around here, man.
I ain’t bullshitting, man.
I went to the strip club the other night – The Brass Key.
[Crowd shouts indistinctly]
It was rough up in there. Smell my fingers. I ain’t bullshitting. Come here, man. I cannot get this cat smell off my hand.
You’re like, “man, what the f*ck?”
A girl squirt some baby milk. I’m like, “what the hell was that all about?”
“I just had a son!”
I said, “do you see him in here?”
Had a c-section scar that went across this way. What you have, a baby or heart surgery? What the f*ck kind of scar is that?
I went and told the manager. I said, “girl’s squirting goat milk over there in the f*cking corner.”
“I know who it is.”
“What the f*ck did you let her work for tonight? You know who it is.”
I love Detroit! Y’all n*ggas is gangsta out here.
[Cheers and applause]
Yeah. I’ve been coming to Detroit since 1989. I went to the Job Corps right there on Jefferson Street.
[Cheers and applause]
My mama sent me up here to be an electrician. I went back home with a finger wave. She’s like, “oh, hell, no. You getting the f*ck out of there.”
I had a briefcase and shit.
“What the f*ck kind of new shit is this? What’s in the briefcase?!”
“Nothing.”
I love y’all n*ggas in Detroit.
Shit.
And n*gga asks why you all here at the show during a recession?
‘Cause y’all are some hustling sons of b*tches.
[Cheers and applause]
I don’t know where you get your money, but you get it. And if you’re poor, we won’t never know it.
Y’all keep y’all fronts all the way up.
You stay down until you come up.
A n*gga won’t never know what you got until he pull you to the side and say,
“man, I’m running on hard times right now.”
[Mumbles indistinctly]
That’s how one of them old players gets some money from you.
They just stare at you for a minute before they say something.
As soon as they catch your eye. “Let me holler about something.”
You’re like, “oh, what this n*gga want right here?”
“Look, man, tell you something, man, you know they took $3,500 from me the other day over there at tony and earl and them homes, right?”
You’re like, “here this n*gga go on one of them stories.”
You see that white man Madoff took all that money. You see that shit? Man, if that was a n*gga, he’d be dead. Shit, you can’t take $1,000 from a n*gga without putting a hit on you.
I’m for real.
You borrow money from a white person, don’t never give it back.
“This is it. This is the last $30.”
You borrow some money from a black person, they’re gonna threaten you before they give it to you.
“Let me tell you about my money, player. I works too hard for my stiff. You know what I mean? I started not to give it to you.”
You be like, “you know what — f*ck you and that $20, all right? About to f*cking lecture me, n*gga.”
The black people give you the money and tell everybody.
“What you doing?”
“Oh, nothing. Just gave Carlos $40. Doing pretty bad this week, man. You know, I guess God will bless me for it, you know what I mean?”
And everybody got to do the right thing, you know what I mean, trying to look out for each other.
You know what I’m saying? Shit, that’s all we got around here, these motherf*ckers, is each other. Shit.
That’s right. We ain’t got none of the old folks no more.
All these little, young kids -they f*cked up.
They ain’t got no direction.
Shit.
These little kids is on everything — slurp, pills, Xanax,
♪ Oxycontin, painkillers, cigarette, weed ♪
♪ Hennessy, vodka ♪
[hums]
These little n*ggas is Martians around here.
They go through 19 emotions.
You be like, “what’s up, little Tony?”
[Screams] “I love you. Ohh! I feel –“
[screams]
Be like, “what the f*ck is wrong with you?”
“I’m on everything.”
I’m retarded. I’ve been in Special Ed all my life. They have surrounded me around retarded kids all my life for nothing. For real. They said, “you retarded –” my mother said, “you was retarded when you was little. And you grew out of it.”
I said, “no, ain’t no f*cking growing out of it.”
I told her, “stop telling people that shit.”
“You was retarded and grew out of it.”
You don’t f*cking grow out of it.
If I was retarded then, I’ll be retarded now, right?
Do I look retarded to any of y’all?
Who’s saying “yeah”? F*ck you, man.
There’s some retarded kids in here ’cause I seen the van pull up outside.
They on a field trip -about six of them together.
That’s how retarded kids walk when they don’t know where they going.
“Toby, over here!”
“Leave me alone. And get out of my face.”
I went to school with a n*gga named junior.
N*gga had a big old booty, wore corduroys every day.
Corduroys and cardboard.
You’d say, “what’s up, Junior?”
“Get out of my face and leave me alone.”
N*gga tongue always hanging out.
“Leave me alone. Leave me alone.”
I walk in the bathroom.
This n*gga done pull his pants all the way down, pissing like this — ass out, belt buckle, underwear, everything down there.
I said, “man, unzip your shit!”
“Leave me alone.”
One day, I’m in the motherf*cking club.
This motherf*cker – this dude pull a hot dog out his pocket — in the bun -ketchup, mustard, everything.
I said, “did this motherf*cker just pull a dressed hot dog out his pocket?”
“Leave me alone.”
I stayed in Special Ed.
And the bell would ring. Teacher -“sit back down.”
I said, “b*tch, the bell just rang.”
“Put your helmet on.”
I said, “I’m not putting no motherf*cking helmet on.”
I was in there with a n*gga had a hand like this, but the n*gga sing R&B. And he’d go —
